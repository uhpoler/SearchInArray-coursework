# SearchInArray-coursework

This is my course work for the second semester of the first year in KPI. The work is done in C++ language using Winforms. I implemented the search for given elements in the array. 
There is a random number generator here, and the search is performed using the:
- sequential search method
- interpolation method of search
- Fibonacci method
- search method using the hash function
